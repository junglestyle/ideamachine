"""The connection judge (SPEC §5, M4): which pairs of clusters are connected, decided by Terra with the prompt it
passed B4 with, behind Jev as a screen (B8).

Embeddings nominate the pairs: every two cards, in the current embedding model, at cosine FLOOR or above, where one
is among the other's K nearest. A pair I linked or unlinked is never asked: my latest decision stands. Jev asks first
whether the two belong in the same tight neighbourhood (jev.QUESTIONS["edge"], as B4's Jev drafts asked it), and
below SCREEN_CUT the pair is screened out without asking Terra. Terra types the rest as B4's sheet showed them, A
being the side with the lower id, so its `A>B` is `a>b`.

Every verdict is kept (im.connection_verdicts, migration 059), so a pair is asked again only when its text as shown
or the judge's method changes. A connection (supports, elaborates, tension, related or same) replaces whatever stood
in for the pair, with its kind (supports, elaborates or tension) as a suggestion; any other verdict (none, unsure, a
refusal, screened) removes the pair's stand-in and any earlier judgment's connection, and lattice.relate doesn't
write the pair again. `same` is also logged for my review (im.merge_review, `judged_same`), never merged.

- supports: one is a reason to believe the other: evidence or an argument for it. Test: if A is true, is B more \
believable, while still saying the same thing? A case that only illustrates it is elaborates.
- elaborates: one fills in the other: a specific case or example of it, a description of how it works, an \
application, a generalization, or something built on it. Test: does one fill in or carry forward the other?
- tension: they pull against each other: a contradiction, a change of mind, a trade-off, or two pulls that would \
have to be balanced. Test: does holding one make the other harder to hold as stated?
- related: they belong together, in the same tight neighbourhood of ideas, but none of the above says how. Test: is \
there more between them than their subject?
- none: no real connection. Being about the same subject, or the same broad area (relationships, emotions, work), \
isn't a connection.
- same: the same idea said twice.
- unsure.
A later version of an idea is elaborates if it refines it, tension if it reverses it, and same if it only says it \
again.
For supports and elaborates, give the direction: "A>B" if A supports or elaborates B, "B>A" the other way, or \
"both" if it runs both ways or you can't say; otherwise "none".
Separately, say whether the two are analogous: about different subjects, but with the same underlying structure \
(the same move, pattern or mechanism in two domains). If they are, name the shared structure in a few words; \
otherwise leave it empty. In `why`, make the case for your label in one sentence: what's between them, or why \
there's nothing beyond their subject. Don't evaluate the ideas."""
