"""The re-read gate: a version change never sends again, unasked, what was already done (docs/install.md).

A paid stage's version changes with its prompt's wording or schema, its model or effort, the privacy policy, a Jev
question set, a cut or a method. Each stage that would then send again what it did under the old version splits what's
due: work never done, and work whose own input changed (a re-transcribed episode's payload, a card whose text
changed), go ahead under the current version as before; work done under another version whose input is the same is
held, its old result staying live, until `im reread STAGE` sends it. `im run` and `im pending` report what's held, per
stage, with what it would cost: the logged cost of those items' last requests.
