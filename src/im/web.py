"""The neutral view (docs/decisions/0007-neutral-proposals.md; the start of Emanation, decision 0005).

Every cluster that passed the gates, newest first, each showing what's known about it: who said it (me, me by
diarization, not me; never a name), in how many conversations, when, its maturity, how I kept it, and its edges.
No score orders or filters anything. From a card I keep a cluster (canonical or pinned), un-keep it or dismiss it,
as feedback events, the same kinds Lattice's keep_idea wrote. A dismissal may say why (feedback.DismissReason), a
choice beside the plain dismiss that's never asked for.

Two more pages draw the same cards (docs/design/m6-emanation.md): Trails (`/trails`), the sky's map with each
conversation as the path it took from thought to thought, and Crossroads (`/crossroads/<id>`), one card with what was
said around it and what's like it; and Echoes (`/echoes`), every connection between thoughts said in different
conversations; and Threads (`/threads`), the neighborhoods of connected thoughts that run through several
conversations; and Apart (`/apart`), the near pairs the connection judge kept apart; and Tree (`/tree`), the Tree of
Life turned in three dimensions, and Grid (`/grid`), a cell a lens, a neighborhood standing in for each lens until
lenses exist. They only read.

Demo mode (a toggle, or `im web --demo` for nothing else) reads the `demo` views instead of `pub`'s, so nothing
sensitive is there to show: the sky keeps a sensitive cluster's star, blank, with its edges, and the lists (the
feed, a card's quotes and connections) leave it out. Nothing can be kept or dismissed in demo mode.

It connects as its own role (IM_WEB_DATABASE_URL, role lattice_app: read pub, append feedback), never as
im_pipeline, and logs in with its token (IM_WEB_TOKEN), exchanged once per device for a signed cookie. Loopback only:
tailscale serve publishes it to the tailnet (install/nas.sh).
