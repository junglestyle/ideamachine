"""A spike, not a stage: can analogies be found by comparing ideas' structure instead of their topic?

The B4 sheet (2026-11-02) had six pairs I marked `none` with an `analogy:` note: different subjects, the same
underlying move. Embeddings place ideas by topic, so they never put such a pair near each other. This tries the
alternative on those pairs: a model writes each cluster's structure in one line with its subject matter removed,
the lines are embedded, and each analogy pair's partner is ranked among all the clusters, by structure and, as the
baseline, by topic. If partners rank high by structure and low by topic, structure is worth a design doc.

Everything goes to the egress log, with names said pseudonymized under policy C (the CLI's default); the structures
and the result are written into the sheet's folder, which quotes people (saved/). Nothing in the lattice changes.
