"""Idea extraction with Claude (docs/decisions/0004-claude-extraction.md).

Each current episode goes out once, and again only if what would be sent changed. Read under another model, prompt
or policy with the same payload, it's held by the re-read gate (im.reread), its captures staying live, until
`im reread extract` reads it again. A payload already read on another episode isn't sent again: its items are reused.
Claude returns items anchored to transcript line numbers; they're mapped back to segment IDs and to who said them
locally. Every request is logged in im.egress_log, and the monthly cap stops the stage once the month's spend reaches
it (egress.send).
