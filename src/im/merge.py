"""Merging two clusters that make one point (`im merge KEEP OTHER`, migration 060).

OTHER is merged into KEEP, and the merge is recorded in im.idea_merges. KEEP's title, statement and note stay as they
are; OTHER's, as shown, go into the record, and its row stays with my events on it, so nothing I wrote is lost and a
merge could be undone.

- Captures: OTHER's move to KEEP as `same_as`, judged_by MERGED, and the match decisions that named OTHER name KEEP,
  so a later read of the same speech follows its observation into KEEP. Typed observations move too.
- Connections and lineage: OTHER's are re-pointed to KEEP, except an embedding stand-in (lattice.relate rebuilds
  KEEP's), one between the two (it disappears), and one where KEEP already has a connection or a judge's verdict
  (KEEP's stands). A kind's direction follows its pair. My links and unlinks on OTHER count for KEEP
  (im.my_link_events). Every connection verdict on OTHER goes: the connection judge nominates KEEP's new neighbors
  on its own.
- Merge review: a row whose clusters are now all one is resolved by this merge (`merge_id`).
- How I kept OTHER, or my mark that it's sensitive, carries to KEEP as a feedback event (source MERGED) when KEEP had
  neither.
- OTHER's derived rows go: embedding, position, weights, sensitivity tags, theme check, an open proposal. Its theme
  memberships move to KEEP, unless I unfiled KEEP from that theme. KEEP's weight is recomputed by the next run, its
  sensitivity tags when its text as tagged (with its first quotes) changed, and its edges' citations now.

From then on OTHER has no text (im.idea_text) and isn't kept (im.idea_kept): it's no card, no matcher candidate and
not embedded, so no capture can join it.

The merge screen (`im merges`, B9m) lists the pairs that may be one point, likeliest first: the open merge review rows
(`duplicate`, `judged_same`) and the near pairs the connection judge nominates (connect.nominate), both clusters
cards, leaving out pairs I unlinked or marked distinct (`idea_distinct`, 061; `im merge --distinct`). Jev's
`same_v2` (jev.QUESTIONS["match"]) on each cluster's title and statement, as the connection judge shows them, orders
it; the group's combined `p` isn't used, since it counts `develops` too. An answer is kept (im.jev_answers) under a
hash of both texts, so a pair is asked again only when either changes. A pair answered under another question set
(its wording or Jev's model) for the same texts is held by the re-read gate (im.reread), ordered by that answer, until
`im reread merges` asks it again. The screen writes nothing else, and never merges.
