"""Sheets that ask one question of a pair of clusters: is there an analogy, or a tension? (decision 0009)

B4 drew its pairs from neighborhoods, so every analogy I found there was between ideas already close by topic,
and the spike that ranked them by structure couldn't say anything about analogies between unrelated ideas
(2026-11-04). And two tensions in 50 pairs can't choose a model. These sheets go looking: each set is a way of
proposing pairs, and a random set beside them says how often the answer is yes by chance.

Analogy (pairs from ideas below the median similarity by topic, so unrelated):
- jev: Jev answers every analogy question (jev.QUESTIONS and jev.PROBES) about a random sample of unrelated pairs,
  and each question proposes its best-scored pairs, so a sheet grades the questions as proposers;
- facets: a model writes each idea's structure as four lines, subject matter removed, so the one an analogy rests
  on is likelier to be there; pairs whose closest lines are closest;
- random: pairs drawn at random, the base rate.
Tension (any similarity):
- apart: neighbors first said far apart in time, where a change of mind would show;
- levels: a claim beside a nearby concrete observation;
- model: a model reads every idea at once and proposes pairs that pull against each other;
- near: neighbors drawn at random, the base rate among related ideas.

The sheet is blind and shuffled like B4's, and the mark is one word: yes, no or unsure. Each pair records which
sets proposed it, so the score says which ways of looking find what, and whether they find the same things. The
sheet quotes people: keep it, and the key, in saved/.
